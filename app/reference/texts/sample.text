File selection block

This block is responsible for file selection, where you can select a file which will be processed later by program.

You have two ways to select file:
- insert path to file -  you can get it from file path of your file manager;
- select file via file dialog - by clicking button You will be presented with a window, where You can select file.

Any way works as expected - program recognizes file and decides if it actually processable or not.
